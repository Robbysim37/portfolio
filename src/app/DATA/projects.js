        I designed it mainly for mobile but it also looks decent on desktop. If you are unfamiliar with
        binary sudoku, check out "0h h1." that website does a great job of teaching you the rules!`,

    description: `Knucklebones was originally a dice based minigame in Devolver Digital's 
        "Cult of the Lamb." I re-created this game in Angular. It's pretty bare bones when it comes to design,
        (pun absolutely intended) but it was my first angular project and I wanted to focus on learning 
        rather than perfecting. If I come back to this project, 
        I'm going to ramp up the AI a LOT more, as of right now, all it does is make random moves.`,

        I made this app while I was learning React, so I spent my time focusing on learning structure and 
        logic as opposed to making it look pretty.`,

        backend) to help my local high school keep track of student records. Before this application they
        tracked the progress of all students through physical paperwork. Clicking this link will take you
        to a YouTube demonstration on how the frontend works, and how I incorperated Excel into its 
        functionality `,
