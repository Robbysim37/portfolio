        "Augment Shell". It's currently in development, but when complete the goal is to have an AI that helps you 
        navigate error's when usng the CLI for linux systems. It's meant to be able to draw up a diagnostics plan and 
        implement that plan to fix any errors. That project is not complete yet, but this is the landing page with a 
        waitlist.`

    description: `Knucklebones was originally a dice based minigame in Devolver Digital's 
        "Cult of the Lamb." I re-created this game in Angular. It's pretty bare bones when it comes to design,
        (pun absolutely intended) but it was my first angular project and I wanted to focus on learning 
        rather than perfecting. If I come back to this project, 
        I'm going to ramp up the AI a LOT more, as of right now, all it does is make random moves.`,

        I made this app while I was learning React, so I spent my time focusing on learning structure and 
        logic as opposed to making it look pretty.`,
